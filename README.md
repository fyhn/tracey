Raytracer

This is a simple raytracer written in Java.
It's not optimized, but rather focused on simple implementation.

It offers a simple language for creating scenes, but you can also generate scenes programmatically with the generateWorld() function.
You can also generate a series of images where the frame number is fed to the generateWorld() function. This can be used to create animations.

The workflow is:
Enter your world generating code in the Source Code tab.
Click Compile and then Render.
or
Write your world generating code in the generateWorld() function
Click Generate and Render
or
Write your world generating code in the generateWorld() function
Click Multi-Render to generate a set of images to disk
then
View the result in the Image tab.

If you want to contribute, feel free to fix the refraction calculations or improve on the language processing.
